the long shopify url that comes when you do shopify dev is actually the development branch. 
When you open localhost, it actually reflects the changes you make in that dev branch. That way, you upload your files assets etc. to test on shopify and you can see how it looks on localhost.

# TODO
the header should act like how it acts on emperor marbles site
also make that grid thing for the hero section
